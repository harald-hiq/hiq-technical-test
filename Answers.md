# 1. How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?

4 hours.

# 2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

Attempted to make the application modular, easily extendable and configurable.

# 3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

* Explore error handling techniques in Spring.
* Case-insensitive counting would have been fun.
* 

# 4. What did you think of this recruitment test?

Not enjoyable at first. The assignment would have been fine in a "real" context, with a clear purpose and a client to satisfy. But it was sadly not fun on its own. I did end up enjoying myself somewhat, however, learning more about Spring Boot and JUnit 5.
